# JACK Drawing Application

Welcome to the JACK Drawing Application! This application allows you to draw on a simulated display using the JACK programming language. It offers intuitive controls and a monitoring dashboard for better user experience.

## Controls

- **Arrows**: Use arrow keys for precise movement across the canvas.
- **S**: Press 'S' to toggle between brush and eraser mode.
- **D**: Press 'D' to enable input (drawing mode). By default, input is disabled to prevent accidental drawing.
- **Z, X**: Press 'Z' to increase and 'X' to decrease the brush size.
- **Q**: Press 'Q' to output your drawing.

## Monitoring Dashboard

On the right side of the application, you'll find a monitoring dashboard. This dashboard provides real-time information about the application's performance, including:

- **Drawing Mode**: Indicates whether the application is in brush or eraser mode.
- **Brush Size**: Shows the current size of the brush.
- **Input Status**: Indicates whether input (drawing) is enabled or disabled.
- **Output Status**: Shows whether any output (drawing) has been saved.
